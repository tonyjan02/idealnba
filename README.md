# CIS 1920 Final Project: Ideal NBA

What makes up the ideal NBA player? In this project, I will be analyzing a Kaggle NBA dataset to craft the perfect NBA player! I want to see what height and weight makes up the best NBA player. I will be using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data and hope to find other pieces of interesting information as well.

This project will be an EDA project where I explore the relationship between an NBA player's success and their attributes (like height, weight, and draft pick number).

I will use the third-party pandas and seaborn modules, and the first-party modules _____.

In order to set-up this project, the kaggle.json file that is attached on this repo has to be downloaded into the drive. For simplicity, it will only work if it is in the main drive folder (sub-folders unfortunately will not work).

Then, all that's left to do is run the code on a Colab Notebook!
