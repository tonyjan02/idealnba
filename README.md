# CIS 1920 Final Project: Ideal NBA

What makes up the ideal NBA player? In this project, I will be analyzing a Kaggle NBA dataset to craft the perfect NBA player! Using ML algorithms we've learned in class, I want to see what height and weight makes up the best NBA player. I will be using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data and hope to find other pieces of interesting information as well, adding complexity to the project as necessary.

If the dataset has enough attributes, I want to see if it's possible to predict a player's performance given advanced statistics about a player, using ML algorithms we've learned in class.
